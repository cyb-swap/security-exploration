### **2. OSI and TCP/IP Models**
- [ ] **OSI Model (7 Layers)**  
  - Physical Layer  
  - Data Link Layer  
  - Network Layer  
  - Transport Layer  
  - Session Layer  
  - Presentation Layer  
  - Application Layer  
- [ ] **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**  
  - Network Interface  
  - Internet  
  - Transport  
  - Application  
- [ ] **Comparison between OSI and TCP/IP Models**  
- [ ] **Role of Protocols in Cybersecurity**  
  - IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, DHCP  


### **3. IP Addressing and Subnetting**
- [ ] **What is an IP Address?**  
  - IPv4 and IPv6  
- [ ] **Subnetting Basics**

- [ ] **Securing Protocols**  
  - SSL/TLS encryption  
  - VPN (Virtual Private Network)  
  - IPsec  


### **5. Network Security Basics**
- [ ] **Firewalls**  
  - Types: Hardware vs. Software  
  - Stateful vs. Stateless Inspection
